# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

These instructions guide you on how to push the `action_tracker_agent` project code to a new GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

*   **Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **GitHub Account:** You need a GitHub account. If you don\t have one, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/).
*   **Project Code:** You should have the `action_tracker_agent` project folder ready.

## Steps

1.  **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**
    *   Log in to your GitHub account.
    *   Click the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
    *   Choose a repository name (e.g., `stateful-action-tracker`).
    *   Optionally, add a description.
    *   Choose whether the repository should be public or private.
    *   **Important:** Do *not* initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license file yet, as we will push our existing files.
    *   Click "Create repository".

2.  **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Change directory (`cd`) into the root folder of the `action_tracker_agent` project (the folder containing `main_agent_loop.py`, `src/`, `README.md`, etc.).
    ```bash
    cd path/to/action_tracker_agent
    ```

3.  **Initialize Git Repository:**
    *   If your project is not already a Git repository, initialize it:
    ```bash
    git init
    git branch -m main  # Rename the default branch to 'main' (optional, but common practice)
    ```

4.  **Create a `.gitignore` File:**
    *   It\s crucial to prevent sensitive files (like `.env` containing API keys) and unnecessary files (like virtual environments) from being committed.
    *   Create a file named `.gitignore` in the project root directory and add the following lines:
    ```gitignore
    # Environment variables
    .env
    
    # Python virtual environment
    venv/
    
    # Python cache
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    *.pyo
    
    # OS generated files
    .DS_Store
    Thumbs.db
    
    # Project data (optional - decide if you want to commit example data)
    # project_data/
    ```
    *   *Note:* Decide whether you want to commit the `project_data/` directory. If it contains sensitive or large data, keep it in `.gitignore`. If it contains example data you want to share, remove that line.

5.  **Add and Commit Files:**
    *   Stage all the project files (except those ignored by `.gitignore`):
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    *   Commit the files with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Add stateful action item tracker agent code and documentation"
    ```

6.  **Link to Your GitHub Repository:**
    *   Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL provided by GitHub on your new repository page (under "...or push an existing repository from the command line").
    *   Add this URL as the remote origin for your local repository. Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL you copied:
    ```bash
    # Example using HTTPS:
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/stateful-action-tracker.git
    
    # Or using SSH:
    # git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/stateful-action-tracker.git
    ```

7.  **Push to GitHub:**
    *   Push your local `main` branch to the remote `origin` repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    *   You might be prompted for your GitHub username and password (or personal access token if using HTTPS with 2FA enabled).

8.  **Verify:**
    *   Refresh your repository page on GitHub. You should see all your project files uploaded.

Your code is now on GitHub!
